# Polarised cross-sections at NLO: frame-boost implementation plan

This document records the assessment of the existing (dead) polarised-NLO code
and the plan to make `p p > z{0} z{0} j [QCD]` work.

**It works.** `check_poles` cancels 20 of 20 points in all 12 P dirs and
`calculate_xsect NLO` gives 4.779e-01 +- 3.3e-03 pb (`me_frame=[3]`, nn23lo1,
fixed scales 91.188, ptj 30, etaj 4.0). See M3 for the gate results.

Status:

| milestone | state |
|---|---|
| M0 plumbing | **done** — run_card option, frame bookkeeping, boost routine, all inert |
| M1 `[LOonly=QCD]` | **done** — Born boosted, validated against LO madevent |
| M2 step 0 | **done** — ISR and FSR emission azimuth carried covariantly |
| M2 rest | **done** — reals + counterterms boosted, azimuthal wiring in, `test_soft_col_limits` passes, `[real=QCD]` enabled |
| M3 `[QCD]` | **done** — `check_poles` cancels 20/20 in every P dir, `calculate_xsect NLO` runs end to end, `[QCD]` enabled |
| M4 | partly done — the guard is open for `[QCD]`; `help_polarization` still to revisit |

`[LOonly=QCD]`, `[real=QCD]`, `[QCD]` and `[virt=…]` all accept a polarised
massive particle today. The first three get their frame from `me_frame` in the
run_card; `[virt=…]` is standalone MadLoop, where the user supplies the
phase-space point and therefore picks the frame themselves (see M3).

Fixed along the way, and **live at LO on its own**: the `me_frame` boost left
the selected leg at rest only to rounding, and HELAS switches quantisation axis
at exactly zero. See M2 step 2. It shifts the shipped LO polarised
cross-section by 1.8% (5 sigma).

## 1. Assessment of the existing implementation

This section records the state **before** this work started; the guard it
quotes has since been rewritten (M3/M4).

### The guard

`madgraph/interface/madgraph_interface.py:1240`

```python
if '[' in process and '{' in process:
    if 'noborn' in process or 'sqrvirt' in process: valid = True
    else: raise InvalidCmd('Polarization restriction can not be used for NLO processes')
    # below are the check when [QCD] will be valid for computation
    # if order.strip().lower() != 'qcd':
    #     raise InvalidCmd('...generic NLO computations')
```

The commented-out block at `:1251` is the only authored trace of an intended
`[QCD]` path. The surviving `check(p)` at `:1254` rejects colour-charged **and
massive** particles, so even `p p > z{0} z{0} [noborn=QCD]` is refused today.
The live NLO polarisation path is massless-colourless loop-induced only, which
is exported through the **LO** madevent template and therefore inherits
`me_frame` for free. That is why an NLO boost was never needed.

### Generation is alive and correct

`FKSLeg` inherits `Leg`, so `polarization` survives; `fks_common.py:747`
(`to_leg`) copies it explicitly. With the guard bypassed in-memory,
`p p > z{0} z{0} j [QCD]` generates cleanly — 8 born processes, with `{0}` on
the Z legs of every born **and** every real:

```
born:  d~ g > z{0} z{0} d~        legs: [(-1,[]), (21,[]), (23,[0]), (23,[0]), (-1,[])]
real:  d~ g > z{0} z{0} d~ g      legs: [(-1,[]), (21,[]), (23,[0]), (23,[0]), (-1,[]), (21,[])]
```

The front end is not the blocker. Everything downstream is.

### The frame machinery is LO-only

| piece | location |
|---|---|
| `boost_to_frame` (pure `boostx`, no rotation) | `Template/LO/SubProcesses/genps.f:1761` |
| `common /to_frame_me/frame_id` | `Template/LO/Source/run.inc:27` |
| call sites | `madgraph/iolibs/template_files/auto_dsig_v4.inc:183`, `:452`, `:488` |
| `mapid` (`ids(i)=btest(id,i)`) | `Template/LO/SubProcesses/cluster.f:128` |
| near-duplicate | `MadSpin/src/driver.f:1924` |

`Template/NLO/` has **zero** occurrences of `frame_id`, `me_frame` or
`boost_to_frame`.

### The six checks

| | status |
|---|---|
| Born boost | **No.** `call sborn(p_born,…)` x20 in `fks_singular.f`, always raw partonic-CM momenta |
| Virtual boost | **No.** `Call BinothLHA(p_born,…)` — `fks_singular.f:7087` |
| Real boost | **No.** `call smatrix_real(pp,wgt)` — `fks_singular.f:4701` |
| Counterterm boost | **No**, for any of them — soft `sbornsoft`, collinear `sborncol_isr`/`sborncol_fsr`, soft-collinear, degenerate `sreal_deg`, `bornsoftvirtual`, `extra_cnt`. Each has its own reduced kinematics (`p1_cnt(0,1,0/1/2)`, `p_born`, `p_born_used`) and so needs its own frame |
| Boost before eikonal/splitting kernel | **No — and this is the hard part** (see M2 step 4) |
| run_card option | **No.** `me_frame`/`frame_id` are added in `RunCardLO` (`banner.py:4438-4440`), resolved at `:4869`, and the `frame` display block is appended only from the LO process-dependent setup (`:5191`). `RunCardNLO` (`:5758`) has none of it |

### On rotations

A rotation is **not** needed for the squared MEs. HELAS builds polarisation
vectors in each particle's own momentum-direction helicity basis, so a rotation
`R` gives `eps_lambda(Rp) = R eps_lambda(p) * exp(-i*lambda*dphi)` — a pure
per-particle phase that cancels in `|M|^2` when every external helicity is
fixed. Born, real and virtual are all rotation-invariant.

Where orientation *does* matter is the collinear counterterm azimuthal phases
(`getaziangles`, and the ISR `cphi_mother=1` assumption). That is where the
"the two Z should be on the z axis" concern actually lands.

## 2. Design decisions

### D1 — Where to apply the boost

Options: inside the generated ME wrappers (`SBORN`, `SMATRIX_REAL`, …), or
caller-side in `fks_singular.f`.

**Recommend caller-side.** `SBORN` caches amplitudes against
`savemom(j,1)=p1(0,j), savemom(j,2)=p1(3,j)`
(`madgraph/iolibs/template_files/born_fks.inc:85-97`) and that cache is shared
with `sborn_sf`, `born_hel` and `extra_cnt` via `calculatedBorn`/`saveamp`. If
one entry point boosts and another does not, the cache silently returns
amplitudes from the wrong frame — a bug with no symptom. Boosting once per
kinematic configuration in the caller makes coherence structural, and gives the
azimuthal code access to the same boost vector.

Concretely: one helper `boost_to_me_frame(p, npart, pboost_out, p_out)` in the
NLO template, plus a common block holding the boost vector for the current
configuration.

### D2 — How `me_frame` indexes legs

At LO, run_card positions == fortran positions, so `mapid` is enough. At NLO
this breaks twice:

- `FKSLegList.sort()` (`fks_common.py:793`) reorders born legs relative to the
  user's process, so user leg *n* != born position *n*.
- Born has `nexternal-1` legs, each real has `nexternal`, with the map given by
  `set_pdg` (`Template/NLO/SubProcesses/chooser_functions.f:454-540`): real *k*
  -> born *k* for `k < i_fks`, born *k-1* for `k > i_fks`, and `i_fks` has no
  born counterpart.

**Decided:** keep `me_frame` in **user process numbering**.

Note the premise above was worse than stated: `sort_proc` (`fks_common.py:731`)
*renumbers* the legs (`leg['number'] = n + 1`) after permuting them, so the
user's numbering is not merely reordered, it is destroyed. Verified: the user
writes `p p > j z{0}` and the born comes out `g d > z{0} d` with the Z carrying
`number=3`, not 4. It therefore cannot be recovered downstream and has to be
captured before `sort_proc` runs.

**Implemented in M0** (see the M0 section for status):

- `fks_common.get_user_leg_order()` computes the FKS ordering on a copy and
  returns the pre-sort numbers; `FKSProcess.__init__` calls it *before*
  `sort_proc` and stores `self.user_leg_order`, which `FKSHelasProcess` carries
  to the exporter.
- `frame_info.inc` per P dir holds only `frame_map_born(nexternal-1)`.
- **No `frame_map_real` table is needed.** The FKS convention already fixes the
  real -> underlying-Born correspondence in terms of `i_fks` alone (`set_pdg`,
  `chooser_functions.f:454-540`): real *r* -> Born *r* for `r < i_fks`, Born
  *r-1* for `r > i_fks`, and `i_fks` itself has no Born counterpart. So
  `get_frame_mask_real` derives the real mask at runtime from the Born one.
  This drops the per-FKS-config table the plan originally called for.

### D3 — Smoothness and equivariance

The frame must be a continuous function of the momenta converging in the
singular limits, or the subtraction stops cancelling. "Rest frame of the sum of
the selected legs, recomputed from *each* configuration's own momenta"
satisfies this: as `xi -> 0` / `y -> 1` the Born's ZZ sum -> the real's ZZ sum.

**Do not** compute the frame once from the real and reuse it for the Born — it
looks simpler and is wrong away from the limit.

**The subtler requirement (equivariance).** A pure boost to the rest frame of a
system is *not* equivariant under longitudinal boosts: `B(L_z P) . L_z != B(P)`
whenever `P` has transverse momentum, the difference being a finite rotation.
So if the reduced Born lived in its own partonic CM rather than in the same
"tilde" frame as the real event, the polarisation axes of the two would differ
by an `O(xi)` rotation, the `1/(1-y)` pole would not cancel, and no azimuthal
fix could repair it.

FKS bookkeeping gives us this for free in the ISR case, and it has been
checked: at `y=1` the ISR mapping applies to the final-state spectators only a
transverse boost whose rapidity vanishes identically
(`genps_fks.f:3055-3068`), and `xp` was initialised from the Born momenta
(`genps_fks.f:1206-1222`). In the tilde frame the real event's spectators are
therefore bit-identical to the Born's -> same sum of selected momenta -> same
`me_frame` boost for real and counter-event -> no residual Wigner rotation of
the Z polarisation axes.

**Action:** assert this at runtime (or at minimum comment it) — check that the
boost 4-vector derived from `p_born_used` and from the real `p` agree at the
counter-event. It is cheap and it protects a property the whole subtraction
rests on.

**Not yet confirmed for FSR:** `generate_momenta_massless_final` applies a
non-transverse `boostwdir2(chybst,…)` to spectators
(`genps_fks.f:2324-2339`). Confirm `shybst -> 0` in the collinear limit before
assuming FSR inherits the same property.

## 3. Milestones

### M0 — Plumbing, no physics — **DONE**

Delivered:

| what | where |
|---|---|
| `me_frame` + `frame_id` in the NLO run card | `banner.py` `RunCardNLO.default_setup`, `frame_id` resolved in `update_system_parameter_for_include` |
| `frame_block` exposed only for polarised massive legs | `RunCardNLO.blocks` + `create_default_for_process` |
| `$frame` placeholder | `Template/NLO/Cards/run_card.dat`, after the beam energies (mirrors the LO card) |
| `common/to_frame_me/frame_id` | `Template/NLO/Source/run.inc` |
| `mapid_frame`, `get_frame_mask_born`, `get_frame_mask_real`, `get_me_frame_boost`, `boost_to_me_frame` | `Template/NLO/SubProcesses/boost_to_frame.f` (new) |
| `boost_to_frame.o` in every executable | `makefile_fks_dir` `FILES` |
| `frame_info.inc` per P dir | `export_fks.write_frame_info_file` |
| user leg order captured pre-sort | `fks_common.get_user_leg_order`, `FKSProcess`, `FKSHelasProcess` |

Gate met. The change is **runtime-inert by construction**, which is a stronger
statement than a bit-identical rerun: `frame_id` is assigned in `run_card.inc`
but read nowhere, and nothing calls the boost routines yet. Verified by grep
over a generated process dir. `p p > z j [QCD]` builds, links and runs clean.

`get_me_frame_boost` returns `trivial=.true.` both when nothing is selected and
when the selected system already has exactly zero 3-momentum, so the default
`me_frame=[1,2]` costs nothing and cannot perturb existing results even once
call sites are added in M1.

Unit-tested numerically (rest frame reached, invariant mass preserved,
4-momentum conservation preserved, in-place aliasing safe).

Also fixed on the way: adding a block to `RunCardNLO` without a `$frame`
placeholder in the card template made `banner.py:3178` append the block at the
end of the file, which broke the `test_default` round-trip in
`tests/unit_tests/various/test_banner.py`. The placeholder is the fix.

Original task list, for reference:

1. `me_frame` + `frame_id` into `RunCardNLO` (`banner.py:5758`), mirroring
   `banner.py:4438-4440`; replicate the `frame_id = sum(2**n)` resolution from
   `:4869` and the `frame` display-block trigger from `:5191` into the NLO
   process-dependent setup.
2. `integer frame_id / common/to_frame_me/frame_id` into
   `Template/NLO/Source/run.inc`.
3. `boost_to_me_frame` + `mapid` into the NLO SubProcesses (port of
   `genps.f:1761`, pure `boostx`, keep the trivial-boost short circuit).
4. Exporter writes `frame_info.inc` per P dir (D2). Add alongside the other
   per-dir includes at `export_fks.py:502`.

**Gate:** `frame_id=6` (default) reproduces current NLO results bit-for-bit on
an unpolarised `p p > z j [QCD]`. Nothing else changes yet.

### M1 — `[LOonly=QCD]`: Born boost only — **DONE**

Gate met. `p p > z{0} j`, matched PDF (nn23lo1), fixed scales (91.188), ptj 30,
etaj 4.0:

| | LO madevent | NLO LOonly | |
|---|---|---|---|
| unpolarised (control) | 6966 +- 6 | 6964 +- 18 | 0.03% |
| `z{0}`, Z rest frame `me_frame=[3]` | 1370 +- 1.7 | 1366 +- 3.1 | 1.1 sigma |
| `z{0}`, partonic c.m. `me_frame=[1,2]` | 974.8 +- 1.0 | 977.3 +- 2.3 | 1.0 sigma |

The unpolarised control matters as much as the polarised rows: it proves the
PDF/scale/cut/channel matching is right, so a polarised disagreement cannot be
blamed on setup. The frame dependence is large (40%) and both codes reproduce
it.

Null test, `p p > z{0} z{0} [LOonly=QCD]`: `me_frame=[3,4]` gives
0.5392 +- 0.0016 pb and `me_frame=[1,2]` gives 0.5401 +- 0.0017 pb (0.4 sigma).
At Born level the ZZ system *is* the partonic c.m., so the boost must be the
identity and the answer must not depend on `me_frame` -- it does not.

Incidentally this also confirms `nhel` is a variance knob, not a correctness
one, for polarised LO: `nhel=1` gives 1369 +- 1.7 against `nhel=0`'s
1370 +- 1.7. `help_polarization` currently implies `nhel=1` is required.

Converted call sites (all three reachable with `abrv='born'`):
`compute_born` (`fks_singular.f:37`), `include_multichannel_enhance`
(`:1505` and the cache-isolated `:1550`), and `bornsoftvirtual` (`:6896`,
not reachable in LOonly but converted for M3).

Guard relaxed for `LOonly` only (`madgraph_interface.py:1240`), including the
massive-particle rejection; `[QCD]` and the other NLO modes are still refused.

Two things learned the hard way; record them before touching M2.

**The fixed-order Born does not come from `bornsoftvirtual`.** It comes from
`compute_born` (`fks_singular.f:1`, the first routine in the file), called from
`driver_mintFO.f:445`, which does its own `call sborn(p_born,wgt_c)` and then
`add_wgt(2,...)`. `bornsoftvirtual` (`:494`) jumps straight to label 549 when
`abrv='born'` and leaves `amp_split_wgtnstmp` at zero, so its `add_wgt(3,...)`
contributes nothing. Converting only `bornsoftvirtual` therefore changed the
answer without ever boosting the Born that is actually integrated. Both sites
are now converted.

**B5 is not hypothetical.** With only `bornsoftvirtual` converted, the run did
not simply stay unboosted: it moved by ~3% (974.8 -> 946.7). Two callers of
`SBORN` disagreed about the frame within one event, and they share both the
`amp_split` common and the `calculatedBorn`/`savemom` cache, so the second
caller either reused amplitudes from the other frame or thrashed the cache.
This is exactly the failure mode D1 predicts, and it is silent -- no crash, no
warning, just a wrong number. Every `SBORN` caller reachable in a given mode
must be converted together, or none.

Original task list:

`[LOonly=QCD]` generates a fake FKS config with no reals and no virtuals
(`export_fks.py:3676`), so this milestone touches exactly one ME call and zero
counterterms. Cheapest possible validation of D1 + D2 + the run_card.

- Boost `p_born` before `call sborn` at the LOonly-reachable sites.
- Relax the guard at `madgraph_interface.py:1240` for `LOonly` only, and drop
  the massive-particle rejection at `:1257` on that branch (today it blocks
  `z{0}` even in the allowed `noborn` mode).

**Gate — acceptance test 1 (`p p > z{0} j`):** `[LOonly=QCD]`
`calculate_xsect LO` vs. LO madevent `generate p p > z{0} j`, same `me_frame`,
same cuts/PDF/scales, `group_subprocesses False`. Must agree inside MC error.
This validates the NLO Born boost against an independently-validated
implementation. Pin `nhel` identically on both sides.

`p p > z{0} z{0}` is a deliberate **null** test here: at Born level the ZZ
system *is* the partonic CM, so the boost must be a no-op and the polarised
LOonly result must be `me_frame`-independent.

### M2 — `[real=QCD]`: reals + counterterms (the hard milestone)

**Step 0 (ISR half) DONE.** The azimuthal factor can now be rebuilt covariantly.

`genps_fks.f` stores `xij_kperp` (common `/cxij_kperp/`) next to `xij_aor` at
both ISR generation sites (`generate_momenta_initial`,
`generate_momenta_initial_noevpr`), zeroed wherever `xij_aor` is zeroed.
`azifact_from_kperp` in `boost_to_frame.f` rebuilds `-exp(2 i psi)` from the
mother direction and that vector.

The reconstruction turned out cleaner than the plan assumed. Using the standard
helicity basis of the mother direction,

    e1 = ( cos(th)cos(ph), cos(th)sin(ph), -sin(th) )
    e2 = (       -sin(ph),       cos(ph),        0  )

reproduces **both** incoming legs with no `idir` bookkeeping at all:

    j_fks=1, n=+z : psi = phi_i      -> -exp( 2 i phi_i)
    j_fks=2, n=-z : psi = pi - phi_i -> -exp(-2 i phi_i)

because the doubled angle turns the basis flip into a harmless 2 pi. This is
*why* B3 is right that the `R_y(pi)` flip must be deleted rather than boosted:
it was only ever compensating for a basis convention that the psi form handles
by construction.

Validated at Lambda=1 against `-exp(2 idir i phi_i)` over 37 azimuths on both
beams: worst deviation 2.4e-16, i.e. one ulp. Exact bit-identity is not
reachable through this route (`(a+ib)^2` vs `exp(2 i phi)` differ in the last
ulp), so the shipped code keeps using `xij_aor` whenever the boost is trivial
and only takes the covariant route when a frame is actually requested --
unpolarised runs stay bit-identical by construction rather than by measurement.

A longitudinal boost leaves the reconstruction *exactly* unchanged (0.0, not
just small), confirming the plan's prediction that a longitudinal-only
`me_frame` is a genuine null and therefore a useful intermediate test.

**Step 0 (FSR half) DONE, and B4 is resolved -- both parts favourably.**

*Which branch runs.* The same one as ISR. `sreal` dispatches to
`sborncol_fsr`/`sborncol_isr` on `pmass(j_fks)` and `j_fks<=nincoming`, but the
collinear and soft-collinear counter-events pass the literal `one` for
`y_ij_fks` (`fks_singular.f:793`, `:904`) in both cases. So FSR also always
takes `azifact = xij_aor`, and its `IXXXXX`/`OXXXXX` branch is live only in the
sliver `vtiny=1e-8 <= 1-y < tiny=1e-6` -- never during `colltest`, where
`tiny=1d-12`.

*Equivariance.* Holds for FSR too. The spectator boost has
`shybst = -(shat-sumrec^2)/(2 sumrec sqrt(shat))` with
`recoil = p_total - p_mother`, which in the partonic c.m. vanishes exactly when
`E_m = |p_m|`, i.e. for a massless mother. Since
`m_mother^2 = 2 E_i E_j (1-y) -> 0`, `shybst = O(1-y) -> 0` in the collinear
limit. So the reduced Born and the real event share a frame in the singular
region and there is no residual rotation of the polarisation axes.

*The FSR reconstruction needs no new machinery.* The emission is generated
about a `+z` mother as `(cos(phi_i),sin(phi_i),0)` and then passed through
`rotate_invar`, which is `R_z(phi) R_y(theta)` and therefore maps `x,y` onto
exactly the `e1,e2` of the helicity basis above. So the rotated vector has
azimuth `phi_i` again, and the *same* `azifact_from_kperp` serves both cases.
The only difference is a conjugation, which is just spacelike vs timelike
splitting:

    ISR net factor = -dconjg( azifact_from_kperp(mother, kperp) )
    FSR net factor = -        azifact_from_kperp(mother, kperp)

Checked at Lambda=1 against the shipped `-(cphi_m - i sphi_m)^2 * xij_aor` over
672 configurations of `(theta_m, phi_m, phi_i)`: worst deviation 1.4e-15.

This also retires the worry that FSR would need its own analysis: the two
cases differ by a conjugation, not by structure.

`[real=QCD]` gives the full FKS subtraction without virtuals — everything hard,
nothing MadLoop.

1. Boost the real momenta before `call smatrix_real(pp,wgt)`
   (`fks_singular.f:4701`).
2. Boost each reduced configuration with its *own* frame: `p1_cnt(0,1,0/1/2)`,
   `p_born`, `p_born_used`, and the `extra_cnt` argument. Sites:
   `fks_singular.f:494` (`bornsoftvirtual`), `:705`/`:793`/`:904` (the
   `sreal`/`sreal_deg` counterterms), plus the ~20 `call sborn` sites.
3. Soft is easy: the eikonal `p_m.p_n/(p_m.k)(p_n.k)` is invariant and
   `sborn_sf` is colour-linked only (no spin correlation), so `sbornsoft` needs
   nothing beyond a boosted `p_born`.
4. **The azimuthal phases — the real work.** `SBORN` returns
   `ANS(2) = BORNTILDE`, the +/- gluon-helicity interference built from
   `JAMPH(1,.)`/`JAMPH(2,.)` (`born_fks.inc:277`). The correction multiplying
   it collapses to `-exp(-2*i*psi)`, with `psi` the emission azimuth about the
   mother in the HELAS `(e1,e2)` basis.

   **No extra Wigner phase is needed on `BORNTILDE`.** The mother's
   little-group phase `exp(-+2*i*theta_W)` cancels against the `exp(+2*i*theta_W)`
   picked up by a *boosted* `<ij>/[ij]` — same `theta_W`, since i, j and the
   mother are collinear. The controlling identity, exact in any single frame
   and for any mother direction, is `arg(azifact)/2 = phi_m + psi`. There is no
   `theta_m` dependence (`R_y(theta)` has a real SU(2) matrix), which is
   exactly why `getaziangles` returning only `phi` suffices. The generator's own
   analytic limits confirm it independently: `genps_fks.f:2344` gives
   `-exp(2i(phi_mother+phi_i))` (FSR), `:3099` gives `-exp(2*idir*i*phi_i)` (ISR).

   The massive-leg (Z) Wigner transformation is *not* a phase but a genuine
   helicity mixing — that is the polarised observable itself, not an error to
   correct. It is why `SBORN` must be handed boosted momenta.

   **ISR — BLOCKER B1, and the branch that actually runs.**
   `fks_singular.f:5034-5035` hardcodes `cphi_mother=1, sphi_mother=0`; that is
   numerically identical to `getaziangles` on a beam-axis momentum
   (its `sth.ne.0` guard at `:4111` returns exactly `(1,0)` for `cth=+-1`) and
   it dies under a boost. But repairing it is not the main problem:

   The ISR counter-events are called with `y_ij_fks = one` **exactly**
   (`fks_singular.f:793`, `:904`; `y_ij_fks_matrix(1)=y_ij_fks_matrix(2)=1.d0`
   at `genps_fks.f:2742`), so `1d0-y_ij_fks .lt. vtiny` always fires and
   `azifact = xij_aor` is taken every time (`:5006-5007`). The
   `IXXXXX`/`OXXXXX` spinor branch below it is live only in the sliver
   `vtiny=1e-8 <= 1-y < tiny`, where `tiny=1d-6` in production and `1d-12`
   under `colltest` (`:4658`) — i.e. it is **never exercised by
   `test_soft_col_limits`**. Both branches still have to be made consistent or
   that sliver becomes a discontinuity nothing catches.

   `xij_aor = -exp(2*idir*i*phi_i_fks)` is a precomputed partonic-CM constant
   (`genps_fks.f:3096-3101`) and a `0/0` limit of `<ij>/[ij]`. A boost maps
   exactly-parallel null vectors onto exactly-parallel null vectors, so **the
   degeneracy survives in every frame — it can never be recomputed after
   boosting.** The azimuthal direction must be carried through as a stored
   4-vector.

   Proposed fix: store `k_perp_dir = (0, cos(phi_i_fks), sin(phi_i_fks), 0)`
   alongside `xij_aor`. One vector covers both beams (for `j_fks=2` the basis
   is `(x, -y)`, so it yields `psi = -phi_i` — precisely the `idir` sign
   already in `xij_aor`, and the `idir` special case disappears). Then boost
   it, project out the mother component, take
   `psi' = atan2(k'_perp . e2, k'_perp . e1)`, apply `-exp(-2*i*psi')`. At
   `Lambda=1` this reproduces current numbers bit-for-bit, so it lands as a
   safe refactor **before** any boost is wired in.

   `azifact` is invariant under independent positive rescalings, so
   `p_i_fks_ev` being the rescaled null vector `p_i/xi`
   (`genps_fks.f:3085-3094`) is harmless: `Lambda(lambda*p) = lambda*(Lambda p)`.

   **ISR is a package of three changes** — do any subset and you apply part of
   the correction, which is worse than the current code:
   (a) carry `k_perp_dir` through the boost as above;
   (b) `getaziangles` on the boosted mother instead of the hardcode;
   (c) **delete** the `j_fks.eq.2` `R_y(pi)` flip (`:5013-5020`) — after a boost
   it no longer maps the mother onto +z. Note `montecarlocounter.f:3000-3006`
   double-encodes the same thing (both the rotation and `cphi_mother=-1.d0`);
   numerically identical today since only the square enters, but do not carry
   both forward.

   **FSR:** `getaziangles(p_born(0,imother_fks), …)` (`:4844`) and `azifact`
   built by `IXXXXX/OXXXXX` on `p_i_fks_ev`, `p(.,j_fks)` (`:4830`) must both be
   evaluated on momenta carrying the *same* boost as the Born. The FSR
   equivalent of B1 has not been checked — establish whether the FSR
   counter-events also collapse onto the `vtiny` branch.

   **Scope narrowing:** `Qterms_reduced_spacelike` returns a real, z-only
   number (`:5538-5584`), non-zero only for a **vector mother** (`col1=8`); the
   `abs(m_type).eq.3 .or. ch_m.ne.0d0` branch that zeroes `Q` and `wgt1(2)` is
   the same statement one level up. So **only gluon-mother ISR configurations
   are affected at all** — a process whose ISR mothers are all quarks passes
   the collinear test even with a completely wrong azimuthal phase. Choose the
   validation channel deliberately.

   This is the frame/orientation consistency issue: it lands on the
   counterterms, not on `|M|^2`.

5. **Same construct elsewhere**, needing the same treatment if polarised
   aMC@NLO (not just fixed-order) is in scope: `montecarlocounter.f:2969-3012`
   and `montecarlocounter_alt.f:1445-1533`. `sreal_deg` (`fks_singular.f:5844`)
   has no azimuthal term — it needs the boost for the ordinary Born only.

**Step 1 (the B5 sweep) DONE.** Every ME entry point now goes through a frame
wrapper, so the boost is a pure function of the momenta passed in.

That is what makes B5 go away *structurally* rather than by inspection: two
callers that pass the same momenta necessarily get the same boost, and two
callers that pass different momenta were already required to reset the cache
between them. No reachability argument is needed, which matters because the
reachability argument is exactly what I got wrong twice in M1.

Wrappers in `boost_to_frame.f`: `sborn_frame`, `sborn_sf_frame`,
`extra_cnt_frame`, `smatrix_real_frame` (the last uses the *real* mask, derived
from the Born one and `i_fks` of the current FKS configuration).

43 call sites converted:

| file | sites |
|---|---|
| `fks_singular.f` | 30 |
| `montecarlocounter.f` | 5 |
| `montecarlocounter_alt.f` | 5 |
| `add_write_info.f` | 1 (this retires **B7**) |
| `check_poles.f` | 1 |
| `test_soft_col_limits.f` | 1 |

Deliberately **not** converted, and why: the EW Sudakov paths
(`check_sudakov*.f`, `ewsudakov_functions_dummy.f`,
`sa_ewsudakov_dummyfcts.f`) are a separate feature, and `symmetry_fks_v3.f` is
`gensym`, a separate executable whose Born calls only seed the integration
grid. Neither shares a process with the integration, so neither can trip the
cache.

**The sweep also exposed a wrong default, worth recording.** With all 43 sites
converted, unpolarised `p p > z j [QCD]` moved from 2.854e+04 to 2.834e+04
+- 1.9e+02 -- only 0.74 sigma, but the two previous runs had been *bit*
identical, so the pipeline is deterministic and a change meant a real change.

Cause: MadFKS does not hand the matrix elements momenta in their own partonic
c.m. `shy_lbst = -xi_i_fks*yijdir/bstfact` is non-zero for any real emission,
so `xp(0,1) != xp(0,2)` (`genps_fks.f:3074-3082`) and the real event lives in a
frame boosted along z. Honouring `me_frame=[1,2]` literally therefore applies a
genuine longitudinal boost to every configuration -- an identity for `|M|^2`,
but not bit for bit, and enough to send the VEGAS grids down a different path.

Confirmed by control: the same build with `me_frame=[0]` (`frame_id=1`, every
mask empty, boost skipped) reproduces 2.854e+04 +- 1.9e+02 exactly. So the
sweep itself is sound and the whole shift came from the boost.

The semantics were right -- boosting to the initial-parton rest frame is what
`[1,2]` means at LO, and the M1 cross-check agreed with LO at 1.0 sigma -- but
the *default* was wrong: an unpolarised run must not pay for machinery it never
asked for. `frame_id` is now 0, meaning "skip", unless `me_frame` actually
appears in the run_card:

| case | frame_id | |
|---|---|---|
| unpolarised (no `me_frame` in the card) | 0 | boost skipped, bit-identical |
| polarised, default | 6 | partonic c.m., as at LO |
| polarised, `me_frame=[3]` | 8 | Z rest frame |

The LO path is untouched: there the momenta really do arrive in the lab frame,
so `[1,2]` has always been a meaningful boost and still is.

**Skip the identity boost structurally, as LO does.** Applying a boost that is
mathematically the identity is not free -- it goes through `boostx` and
perturbs the momenta in the last bits, which is enough to move an adaptive
integration. LO avoids this in *two* places, and the NLO port now folds in
both:

- the call site skips `frame_id=6` outright (`auto_dsig_v4.inc:183`);
- `boost_to_frame()` skips the all-final-state selection (`genps.f:1782`),
  whose comment says of the initial-state case: *"1 1 0 0 0 .... should not go
  within this function"*.

`get_me_frame_boost` now returns `trivial` for four cases: nothing selected,
exactly the initial state, exactly the whole final state, and an already-at-
rest system. Relying on the last one alone (as the first version did) is not
enough at NLO, because the tilde frame means it never fires.

**`me_frame` must not be built from the initial state at NLO -- it is not
infrared safe.** This is a stronger statement than the numerical one above and
it constrains what the feature may *accept*, not just what it skips. The real
emission and the reduced Born carry momentum fractions that differ by a finite
amount even in the singular limit, so a frame defined from the initial state is
discontinuous across that limit and the subtraction stops cancelling. No
azimuthal fix can repair it -- this is the same failure mode as the
equivariance discussion in D3, but caused by the frame *definition* rather than
by the mapping.

Consequently `RunCardNLO.check_validity` rejects an `me_frame` that mixes
initial-state legs with final-state ones. `[1,2]` and the full final state stay
accepted, since they merely name the partonic c.m. and are skipped. Frames
should be defined from final-state particles only, which is what the physics
wants anyway: the polarised system (the Z, the ZZ pair) is a set of final-state
spectators, present unchanged in both the real and the Born.

Re-validated after this change -- unpolarised 2.854e+04 +- 1.9e+02 (baseline),
`z{0} j` Z-frame 1366 +- 3.1 and partonic c.m. 977.3 +- 2.3, both identical to
the M1 numbers. The skip reproduces the boost exactly for `[LOonly=QCD]`, as it
must: with no emission `shy_lbst=0` and the Born really is in the partonic c.m.

**Step 2 (azimuthal wiring) DONE. The M2 gate PASSES and `[real=QCD]` is
enabled.**

`azifact_me_frame` rebuilds the frame from the same Born momenta the matching
`sborn_frame` call gets, boosts the mother and `xij_kperp` together, and
returns `-exp(2 i psi)`. Both `sborncol_isr` and `sborncol_fsr` use it in their
boosted branch and, there, apply neither the `cphi_mother=1` shortcut, the
`R_y(pi)` flip, nor `getaziangles` -- the psi form carries all of them (**B3**).
The legacy branch is untouched, so unpolarised runs stay bit-identical.

It first failed the gate: `test_ME` on `p p > z{0} j [real=QCD]` with
`me_frame=[3]` gave soft 0.48, collinear 0.37. The section below is the
diagnosis. It was *not* a frame-consistency bug and the azimuthal work was
never implicated.

### The failure: the quantisation axis was decided by rounding

**Root cause.** For a one-leg `me_frame` selection -- `me_frame=[3]`, "the Z
rest frame", which is the standard way to ask for Z polarisation -- the boost
puts that leg at rest, and *there the boost has to be exactly right rather than
right to rounding*.

HELAS changes convention at exactly zero. `vxxxxx` (`aloha_functions.f`) builds
the polarisation vectors of a massive vector from

    pp = min(|p(0)|, sqrt(p(1)^2+p(2)^2+p(3)^2))

and branches on `pp.eq.rZero`: at exactly zero it uses the **z axis** of the
current frame as the quantisation axis, and otherwise it uses the **momentum
direction**, giving `eps_L = (pp/m, E*p/(m*pp))`.

`boostx` does not reach `p=0` exactly. With `q=(E,-P)` and `p=P` it forms
`p(i)+q(i)*lf` where `lf` is 1 only up to the rounding of `(q(0)-m)+p(0)`, so
the residual is a few `1d-14` pointing in a direction that is pure noise.
Whether it rounds to zero is a coin flip, decided independently for the real
and for the reduced Born. Every configuration that misses zero gets `eps_L`
pointed along rounding noise instead of along z, and the subtraction is then
comparing two different observables.

**Evidence.** Instrumented `boost_to_me_frame` to print `|p|` of the selected
leg after the boost, alongside the soft-limit ratio table, on
`p p > z{0} z{0} [real=QCD]` with `me_frame=[3]`. One-to-one, no intermediate
values:

| residual `|p_Z|` after the boost | soft ratio |
|---|---|
| 0 (exact) | 0.9033, 0.9901, 0.9990, 0.9999, 1.0000, 1.0000, 1.0000 |
| 2.95e-14 | 0.0021716, 0.0021716, 0.0021716 |

The Born landed on exact zero for every point sampled; the real missed it 30%
of the time. A factor 460 in `|M|^2`, from a 3e-14 momentum.

**Fix** (`boost_to_me_frame`, `Template/NLO/SubProcesses/boost_to_frame.f`):
when the selection is a single leg, zero that leg's 3-momentum exactly after
boosting. This imposes the defining property of the frame instead of hoping
for it, and removes the choice. Only `nsel=1` needs it -- with two or more
selected legs it is their *sum* that is at rest, no individual leg sits on the
branch point, and the residual of the sum never reaches HELAS.

### `p p > z z` was the right thing to run first

It was decisive, but not in either of the two ways this document predicted.
`me_frame=[3]` on `p p > z{0} z{0} [real=QCD]` reproduces the `z{0} j` symptom
exactly -- soft 0.55/0.68, collinear 0.54/0.57, uniform -- and there every ISR
mother is a quark, so `Q` vanishes identically and the azimuthal phase is
provably not involved. That reduced the search to the boost itself on a process
that builds in a quarter of the time.

The `me_frame=[3,4]` spelling suggested in the previous revision would have been
a much weaker probe: it fails only a split-order soft test (0.43/0.30) while the
summed test passes, and for a *different*, purely numerical reason -- see below.

**What the D3 instrumentation actually showed.** The boost 4-vectors were
printed for the real and for the reduced Born at the same counter-event, as D3
asks. They converge cleanly: on `me_frame=[3,4]` the real's boost runs
`(553.24, -13.00, 25.52, ...)` down to `(552.50, -1.2e-8, 2.4e-8, ...)` against
the Born's constant `(552.50, 0, 0, ...)`, i.e. the transverse part vanishes
like xi exactly as D3 requires. **The working hypothesis of a finite frame
mismatch was wrong**, and so was the reasoning that led to it. There is no need
for a permanent D3 assertion: the property holds, and the thing that broke was
downstream of it.

### A second, independent finding: the same bug is live at LO

`boost_to_frame` (`Template/LO/SubProcesses/genps.f:1759`) has the identical
defect, and `me_frame` is a *shipped* LO feature. Measured on LO madevent,
`p p > z{0} j`, `me_frame=[3]`, nn23lo1, fixed scales 91.188, ptj 20, etaj 5:

| | cross-section |
|---|---|
| before the fix | 1399 +- 3.4 pb |
| after the fix | 1424 +- 3.8 pb |

1.8%, 5 sigma. So a fraction of LO events had been getting a rounding-noise
polarisation axis all along. The same fix is applied there.

This also matters for M1: that milestone's gate is NLO `[LOonly=QCD]` against
LO madevent, so fixing only the NLO side would have made the two disagree.
Re-validated with both fixed, same cuts and PDF: LO madevent 1424 +- 3.8 vs
NLO `[LOonly=QCD]` 1427 +- 3.0, **0.6 sigma**.

### A precision floor, and the betamin guard

Separately, `me_frame=[3,4]` on `p p > z{0} z{0}` failed the *split-order* soft
test at 0.43/0.30 while the summed test passed. That one is not physics.

That selection is the whole Born final state, so its boost degenerates to the
identity as xi -> 0. Applying a near-identity boost is actively harmful: it
tilts the incoming partons off the beam axis by O(beta), and the HELAS massless
spinors are built from `sqrt(p(0)+p(3))`. On the axis that sum is exactly zero
and the exact branch is taken; tilted by beta it is `E*beta^2/2`, computed as a
difference of two numbers of size E, hence carrying absolute error `ulp(E)` and
relative error `2*eps/beta^2`. Measured down the soft scan, `p(0)+p(3)` of the
boosted incoming leg and the deviation of the ratio from 1:

| `p(0)+p(3)` | 3.3e-9 | 3.3e-11 | 3.4e-13 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ratio - 1 | 9e-6 | 6.5e-4 | 2.1e-2 | 2e-6 | 4e-7 | 2e-6 |

Exactly `1/beta^2` while `p(0)+p(3)` is a few ulp, clean again once it
underflows to exactly zero.

Balancing what the boost delivers (O(beta)) against what it costs
(`30*2*eps/beta^2`, the 30 measured above) gives `beta* = 2.4e-5`.
`get_me_frame_boost` now skips the boost below `betamin=1d-4`, one safety
decade above that. Scanned: `1d-5` is not enough (0.16 still failing), `1d-4`
and `1d-3` both give 0.01. This costs no physics -- it fires only where the
selected system is at rest to one part in 10^4, which never happens in an
integration, only in the artificial deep-soft scan of `test_soft_col_limits`.
Confirmed neutral: the `[real=QCD]` cross-section is 2.604e+03 +- 2.8e+01 pb
without the guard and 2.600e+03 +- 2.2e+01 pb with it, 0.1 sigma.

### Gate results

`p p > z{0} j [real=QCD]`, `me_frame=[3]`, nn23lo1, fixed scales -- the
process this document names as the **discriminating** one, and the one whose
gluon-initiated channels exercise the azimuthal `Q` term:

| | test_ME |
|---|---|
| before | 268 FAILED of 512 test lines, all 12 P dirs |
| after | **0 FAILED of 512**, worst failure fraction 0.08 against a 0.30 threshold |

`calculate_xsect NLO` then runs end to end: **2.600e+03 +- 2.2e+01 pb**.

`p p > z{0} z{0} [real=QCD]`, all frames, `P0_ddx_z0z0`:

| `me_frame` | frame_id | before | after |
|---|---|---|---|
| none | 0 | passes (0.01) | passes (0.01), unchanged |
| `[3]` | 8 | FAILS 0.55/0.68 | passes, worst 0.08 |
| `[3,4]` | 24 | FAILS 0.43/0.30 | passes, worst 0.01 |

Unpolarised runs are untouched **by construction**, not by measurement:
`frame_id=0` makes every mask empty, `get_me_frame_boost` returns `trivial` on
`nsel=0` before reaching either new branch, and `boost_to_me_frame` returns
before the `nsel=1` block.

The guard at `madgraph_interface.py` now accepts `real` alongside `loonly`.

### One thing that was checked and left alone

The "exactly the whole final state" skip in `get_me_frame_boost` is
multiplicity-dependent, so it does not mean the same thing for the Born and for
the real: `me_frame=[3,4]` on `p p > z z` is the whole Born final state but only
two of three real legs. That asymmetry looked like the bug and is not: removing
the skip leaves the failure fractions **bit-identical**, because `p_born` is
handed to us in the Born partonic c.m., so the zero-3-momentum test catches the
same case anyway. Reverted, and the reason recorded in the source.

**Recommended order within M2:**

0. Refactor the ISR azimuthal factor to the `psi`-form at `Lambda=1` (the
   `k_perp_dir` construction above, boost = identity). Demand **bit-identical**
   `test_ME`. This de-risks the hardest change before any frame logic exists.
1. Wire in a **longitudinal-only** `me_frame` boost. Must also be unchanged —
   the mother stays on the beam axis and the z-rotation Wigner phase of a
   z-directed massless particle is trivial, so the existing hardcode remains
   exactly correct. A useful null.
2. Then the general boost.

**Gate — `test_soft_col_limits`.** Already runs automatically as `test_ME` on
every `calculate_xsect` (`amcatnlo_run_interface.py:5494`,
`Template/NLO/SubProcesses/test_soft_col_limits.f`; the collinear scan at
`:617-663` drives `1-y = 1e-2 … 1e-10`). The `Q(z)` azimuthal term is the
*same order* in the collinear limit as the `AP(z)` term, so a wrong phase does
not cancel — the ratio plateaus off 1. Run it before any cross-section
comparison.

**Gate — acceptance test 2 (`p p > z{0} z{0}`):** the Born boost is trivial but
the real has `z z j`, so in the *finite* region the ZZ frame != partonic CM.
This exercises the real boost with the Born held fixed.

**But it does not discriminate the azimuthal phase.** In the singular region —
which is precisely where `test_soft_col_limits` probes — the reduced Born is
`p p > z z` with zero pT(ZZ), so the `me_frame` boost degenerates to
longitudinal and the phase issue does not bite. `p p > z{0} z{0}` will pass
either way. The discriminating processes are those whose `me_frame` system
recoils already at Born level: **`p p > z{0} j`** and **`p p > z{0} z{0} j`**,
restricted to gluon-initiated channels (see the scope narrowing above).

### M3 — `[QCD]`: virtual — **DONE, GATE PASSES**

`binothlha_frame` boosts the momenta handed to `BinothLHA`, which passes them
straight to `sloopmatrix_thres` and takes `born_wgt` from the caller rather
than recomputing it, so one call site covers the virtual.

**Resolved.** The integration was already right; the *gate* was the thing
comparing two frames. `check_poles.f` had been converted by the M2 sweep on
its Born line only — `call sborn_frame(p_born, born)` — while the line
immediately below it still called `BinothLHA(p_born, …)` directly, on the
unboosted `p_born`. So the driver handed MadFKS a Born in the Z rest frame
and MadLoop a phase-space point in the partonic c.m., and then compared the
poles the two produced. Routing it through `binothlha_frame`, exactly as
`bornsoftvirtual` already does at `fks_singular.f:7123`, makes the check
pass. The rest of this section is the original failure report followed by the
diagnosis, the evidence and the gate results.

#### What the failure was

`check_poles` on `p p > z{0} j [QCD]` with `me_frame=[3]`: **poles do not
cancel**, 20 miscancellations. `test_ME` was clean on the same run (0 FAILED,
40 PASSED), which correctly said M2 was unaffected and the problem was on the
virtual side.

The pole coefficients were read as saying it is not a normalisation:

    COEFFICIENT DOUBLE POLE:  MadFKS -3.23e-3  OLP -4.88e-5   ratio 66
    COEFFICIENT DOUBLE POLE:  MadFKS -5.13e-3  OLP -9.43e-5   ratio 54
    COEFFICIENT SINGLE POLE:  MadFKS -4.06e-3  OLP -7.56e-5   ratio 54

"the ratio is O(50-60) and *not* constant, so MadLoop is evaluating a
different polarisation state rather than the same one with a wrong factor."

**That reading was wrong, and it is what sent the search into MadLoop.** The
three lines above come from three *different* phase-space points (points 4, 5
and 6 of the scan), one line each — so the varying ratio is a comparison
across points, not within one. Grouped by point, the ratio is *exactly*
constant: point 1 gives 58.03 for the double pole and 58.03 for the single,
point 2 gives 81.01 and 81.01, and only the per-point value moves. Both poles
are proportional to the Born, so a per-point constant ratio says the two
sides disagree about the Born by an overall factor, i.e. about the frame.
Group diagnostics by phase-space point before drawing conclusions from them.

Two MadLoop settings were suspected and both were correctly **excluded by
test**:

- `NRotations_DP`/`NRotations_QP` re-evaluate the loop at a rotated PS point and
  expect `|M|^2` unchanged -- which fails for a particle at rest, whose axis is
  the frame z axis and does not rotate with the momenta. But both **default to
  0**, so the rotation test never runs. Latent hazard, not this bug. Keep them
  at 0 for polarised runs.
- `ImprovePSPoint` (default 2) deforms the PS point to restore exact
  onshellness and could move the deliberately-zeroed leg off zero. Setting it
  to `-1` (no deformation in double precision) **does not fix it**: still 20
  miscancellations, ratio still ~58.

#### The diagnosis

**MadLoop's polarisation restriction was never the problem, and that was
checked before anything else was touched.** MadLoop reads its helicity
configurations from `MadLoop5_resources/<prefix>HelConfigs.dat`, and for
`P0_gd_z0d` that file holds exactly the eight rows of `born.f`'s `NHEL`
table, with the Z entry pinned to `0`:

    -1  1  0 -1        -1 -1  0 -1         1  1  0 -1         1 -1  0 -1
    -1  1  0  1        -1 -1  0  1         1  1  0  1         1 -1  0  1

`NCOMB=8` in `loop_matrix.f` against `MAX_BHEL=8` in `born_nhel.inc`. The
Born and the virtual sum over the same helicity set. `hel_avg_factor` is
restored as `loop_exporters.py:1552` intends. Nothing to fix there.

**Instrumentation closed it.** A `diag_frame` routine in `check_poles.f`
prints, for each point, the selected leg's `|p|` before and after the boost
and the Born evaluated both ways (`sborn` on the raw `p_born`, and
`sborn_frame`), with `calculatedborn` reset between the two so the shared
amplitude cache does not fight. The Z goes from `|p| = 318.6` to exactly `0`,
as `boost_to_me_frame` guarantees for `nsel=1`, and:

| point | Born(me_frame)/Born(partonic c.m.) | MadFKS/OLP pole ratio | rel. diff |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 58.0338377763 | 58.0338377763 | 1.7e-14 |
| 2 | 81.0065550136 | 81.0065550136 | 6.9e-14 |
| 3 | 64.0169796788 | 64.0169796788 | 4.4e-15 |
| … | | | |
| 20 | 57.8773835460 | 57.8773835460 | 1.3e-14 |

All 20 points agree to 1e-13. The pole mismatch *is* the ratio of the two
Borns, with nothing else in it.

The chain that produces it: `getpoles` (`fks_singular.f:7574`) ignores its
`p` argument for the Born and reads `common/pborn/p_born`, then calls
`sborn_frame` on it — so the MadFKS poles are always in the me_frame.
MadLoop's poles come from whatever momenta `BinothLHA` was handed. In the
integration that is `binothlha_frame`'s boosted copy and the two agree; in
`check_poles.f` it was the raw `p_born` and they did not.

#### The fix

One line, `Template/NLO/SubProcesses/check_poles.f:228`:

```fortran
-          call BinothLHA(p_born, born, virt_wgt)
+          call binothlha_frame(p_born, born, virt_wgt)
```

`check_poles.f` is compiled only into the `check_poles` executable (`POLES`
in the P-dir makefile; the integration uses `driver_mintFO.o`), so no
cross-section can move as a result of this change — only the diagnostic that
was misreporting.

Unpolarised runs are unaffected, by measurement as well as by construction:
with `frame_id=0` every mask is empty, `get_me_frame_boost` returns `trivial`
and `boost_to_me_frame` copies the momenta unchanged. Rebuilt
`P0_gd_zd/check_poles` of unpolarised `p p > z j [QCD]` both ways — the two
logs are **byte-identical**.

The two settings excluded by the previous session stay excluded, and the
passing run now confirms it positively rather than by elimination: it ran
with the shipped defaults `ImprovePSPoint = 2`, `NRotations_DP = 0`,
`NRotations_QP = 0`.

#### Gate results

`p p > z{0} j [QCD]`, `me_frame=[3]`, nn23lo1, fixed scales 91.188, ptj 30,
etaj 4.0, `req_acc_fo 0.05`:

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| `check_poles`, `P0_gd_z0d` | 0 of 20 pass | **20 of 20** |
| `check_poles`, all 12 P dirs | — | **20 of 20 in every one** |
| `test_ME`, all 12 P dirs | passed | passed, unchanged |
| `calculate_xsect NLO` | — | **2.193e+03 +- 1.2e+01 pb** |

Agreement is now at the level of the loop-library accuracy, not the
tolerance: e.g. MadFKS `-5.1257915456849783e-03` against OLP
`-5.1257915456856262e-03`.

Unpolarised control, `p p > z j [QCD]`, same cuts and scales: `check_poles`
20 of 20 in all 12 P dirs, `calculate_xsect NLO` 1.029e+04 +- 5.5e+01 pb.

That control also gives a physics sanity check the pole cancellation cannot,
since the M1 table has the Born of both at the same cuts and scales:

| | Born (`[LOonly=QCD]`) | NLO (`[QCD]`) | K |
|---|---|---|---|
| unpolarised | 6964 +- 18 | 10290 +- 55 | 1.48 |
| `z{0}`, `me_frame=[3]` | 1366 +- 3.1 | 2193 +- 12 | 1.61 |

Both K factors are the O(1.5) expected for Z+jet at `muR=muF=mZ` with
`ptj>30`, and the polarised one is close to but not equal to the unpolarised
one — which is what a correct polarised NLO should look like. A frame bug of
the kind M3 hit would not have landed anywhere near here.

Two further processes, same settings:

| process | `me_frame` | P dirs | `check_poles` | `test_ME` | xsec |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `p p > z{0} z{0} [QCD]` | `[3]` | 4 | 20/20 each | passed | 1.217e+00 +- 6.6e-03 pb |
| `p p > z{0} z{0} j [QCD]` | `[3]` | 12 | 20/20 each | passed | 4.779e-01 +- 3.3e-03 pb |

The second is the process this document names as the M3 acceptance test.

#### What the guard now accepts, and what it still refuses

A polarised massive particle needs a frame. There are **two** ways to have
one, and the guard now recognises both.

*Frame from the run_card.* Modes `loonly`, `real` and `all` — the last being
what the parser calls `[QCD]` with no mode keyword (`LoopOption='all'`,
`madgraph_interface.py:5104`) — **for a purely QCD perturbation**. These are
the modes whose matrix elements this work boosts.

*Frame from the user.* Mode `virt` outputs standalone MadLoop: the caller
supplies the phase-space point, so the frame is theirs to choose and there is
no `me_frame` and nothing for the code to get wrong. Accepted for **any**
perturbation orders, since the frame argument does not depend on them. This
was initially refused on the grounds that "it has no run_card, so it has no
frame" — which had the implication backwards. Confirmed by running it:
`p p > z{0} j [virt=QCD]` does reject `order=NLO`, `fixed_order=ON` and
`set me_frame [3]` at the launch prompt, because it is a standalone check and
not an integrable process directory. That is the point, not a problem.

**Unblocking `virt` exposed a separate bug, which had to be fixed for the
unblock to mean anything.** `p p > z{0} j [virt=QCD]` was generating
`P0_gu_zu` — no `z0` — with 24 helicity configurations covering all three Z
polarisations. The user would have asked for a polarised loop and silently
received the unpolarised one.

The polarisation is dropped by the **multiparticle expansion**, and only on
the MadLoop path. `u u~ > z{0} g [virt=QCD]` (explicit flavours) is correct —
`P0_uux_z0g`, 8 configurations, Z pinned to `0`. Tree level is correct with
multiparticles too. The culprit is `ProcessDefinition.__iter__`
(`base_objects.py:4670`), whose own docstring says *"not used by MG which
used some smarter version (use by ML)"*: it rebuilds each expanded leg as
`Leg({'id':id, 'state':…})` and never carries `polarization` across.
`loop_interface.py:885` iterates it and re-issues each combination as a text
command, so by the time `nice_string` runs the `{0}` is already gone.
`MultiProcess.generate_multi_amplitudes` — the path MG5 itself uses — copies
`polarization` properly, which is why only the loop side was affected.

Fixed by carrying the multileg's `polarization` onto each expanded leg.
`p p > z{0} j [virt=QCD]` now gives `P0_gu_z0u` with 8 configurations in all
seven subprocess MEs; unpolarised `p p > z j [virt=QCD]` still gives 24, so
nothing else moves.

Validated by running the standalone check, which has its own version of the
check_poles argument: the IR pole coefficient is a colour factor times the
Born, so `1eps/(born*ao2pi)` must be the same whether or not the helicities
are restricted, while the Born itself must differ.

| `g u > z u` | Born | `1eps/(born*ao2pi)` |
|---|---|---|
| `z{0}` | 3.1963946124086368e-04 | -4.1666666666641756 |
| unpolarised | 0.55343246189280271 | -4.1666666666665897 |

Both give -25/6. Had the loop summed all helicities while the Born stayed
restricted, this ratio would have been wrong — the same signature that gave
M3 away.

**The sibling defect, and why it has to land with this change.**
`ProcessDefinition.get_process` (`base_objects.py:4849`) hardcodes
`'polarization':[]` the same way. Verified on this branch:

    multileg pol : [[], [], [0], []]
    get_process  : [(2, []), (-2, []), (23, []), (21, [])]     shell: 0_uux_zg

Its callers are the `check` command paths. That matters here because
`check_check` runs `check_process_format` (`madgraph_interface.py:1156`), so
**opening `virt` in the guard also newly admits
`check timing|stability|profile <polarised massive process> [virt=QCD]`**,
which was refused before. Without the `get_process` fix that check silently
runs the *unpolarised* loop. Tree-level `check` is unaffected by the guard —
it has no brackets, so the polarisation branch never fires — and its version
of the bug is purely pre-existing.

Fixed separately on branch `claude/quizzical-ptolemy-16f0c8`, commit
`2b151185d`, which also found a **third** instance:
`process_checks.py:2032` `run_multiprocs_no_crossings` built its legs with no
polarization at all, and that is the function every tree-level `check` goes
through — so fixing `get_process` alone would have left `check
gauge/lorentz/permutation` unpolarised. Their evidence, `check permutation
p p > z{…} j --seed=1`:

| | value |
|---|---|
| `g Q > z{0} Q` | 3.1783208585e-04 |
| `g Q > z{T} Q` | 1.0612625837e-01 |
| `g Q > z Q` (unpolarised) | 1.0644409045e-01 |

the two polarised pieces summing exactly to the unpolarised one.

**So `2b151185d` should land together with this change, not after it.** The
guard here opens the door; that commit is what makes what is behind it
correct. Its loop-side caller (`process_checks.py:2111`,
`generate_loop_matrix_element` — the `check timing/stability/profile` path)
is a pure data carry but is **unverified at runtime** on either branch, and
it is exactly the combination this guard newly admits. Worth one polarised
`check timing` run before relying on it.

Two further things to know before using `check` on these processes, neither
of them caused by this work:

- `run_multiprocs_no_crossings` builds its legs with no `flavor` key, so
  `_flavor_group_pos` returns 1 for every leg and **only flavour index 1 is
  actually gauge-checked** once flavour grouping is on (the default). A
  passing `check` covers less than the summary line suggests;
  `set apply_flavor_grouping False` restores the per-flavour table.
- FD/axial gauge on a process with a cross-base FLV routine (`FFVx_FFSy`,
  classically massive-lepton Goldstone-Yukawa) was broken in every backend
  until `6a8530f84` on `claude/bold-mestorf-777ea7` — the call site emitted
  `FFV2_FFS3_0` against ALOHA's `FFV2_FFS3M_0`. It does **not** affect the
  processes in this document: grepping the generated `p p > z{0} j [QCD]`
  tree finds no cross-base combined routines at all, so `tags` is empty and
  the fix is a no-op here. Checked rather than assumed.

Still refused, each for a reason rather than by omission:

- `[QED QCD]` and `[QED]` in the boosted modes. The frame wrappers are
  order-agnostic and the QED counterterms (`particle_charge`, the charge
  links, `sreal_deg`) go through the same `sborn_frame`/`sborn_sf_frame`, so
  this is likely to work — but nothing in the QED sector has been run, and
  the plan does not cover it. `[virt=QED]` is fine, being standalone.
- `[noborn=QCD]` with a *massive* polarised particle. Pre-existing and
  unchanged: loop-induced is exported through the LO madevent template and so
  already has `me_frame`, but `check()` has always rejected massive there.
  Worth revisiting; not touched here because nothing in this work exercises
  it. See section 1.

`tests/unit_tests/interface/test_cmd.py::test_check_generate` encoded the old
restriction (`'u u~ > w+{L} [QCD]'` in the *invalid* list) and is updated: the
massive-colourless QCD forms and both `[virt=…]` spellings move to the
accepted list, `[QED QCD]` and `[QED]` stay in the rejected one. It was that
test that caught the first version of this change quietly opening mixed-order
NLO.

#### What this milestone cost, and why

The instrumentation-over-reasoning lesson from M2 held again, and more
sharply. Every hypothesis on the list — the helicity restriction,
`ImprovePSPoint`, `NRotations`, quadruple-precision promotion — was internal
to MadLoop, because the one misread number said "MadLoop is computing
something else". The bug was one line above the call, in the driver, in code
this project had already touched. Both times the search went to the most
intricate component available, and both times the answer was in the plumbing.

Original plan for this milestone:


Boost `p_born` before `Call BinothLHA(p_born,…)` (`fks_singular.f:7087`).
MadLoop already handles polarised MEs (`loop_exporters.py:1552` restores the
helicity-averaging factor). Note MadLoop has its own stability rescue that
re-evaluates in rotated/boosted frames — check it does not fight the imposed
frame.

**Gate:** `check_poles` must still pass (the poles are proportional to the
Born, so a Born/virtual frame mismatch shows up as a pole mismatch). Then
`p p > z{0} z{0} j [QCD]` end to end.

### M4 — Unblock and document — **partly done**

Done in M3: the guard now accepts `loonly`, `real` and `all`, deriving the
mode the same way the parser does (no keyword in the brackets means `all`),
and `check()` no longer rejects a massive particle in those modes. The stale
commented-out `order != 'qcd'` guard is deleted, along with the dead `order`
it parsed.

Remaining:

- `help_polarization` (`:803`) does not say `me_frame` is LO-only, but it
  does not say it works at fixed-order NLO either — add that, and say which
  modes accept it;
- the acceptance test in section 4 is written up but not yet added to
  `tests/acceptance_tests/test_cmd_amcatnlo.py`;
- decide whether `[noborn=QCD]` should accept a massive polarised particle.
  It is loop-induced, exported through the LO madevent template, so it has
  `me_frame` already; `check()` has always refused massive there and nothing
  in this work exercises it.

## 4. Acceptance test

One new test in `tests/acceptance_tests/test_cmd_amcatnlo.py`, modelled on
`MECmdShell.generate` + `self.do('calculate_xsect LO -f')` (`:722`), with the
reference LO numbers produced the way `tests/acceptance_tests/test_cmd_madevent.py:2870`
does it.

| stage | process | mode | assertion |
|---|---|---|---|
| M0 | `p p > z j [QCD]` unpolarised | NLO | xsec unchanged vs. today (regression) |
| M1 | `p p > z{0} j` | `[LOonly=QCD]` vs LO madevent | agree within MC error |
| M1 | `p p > z{0} z{0}` | `[LOonly=QCD]` | `me_frame`-independent (null test) |
| M2 | `p p > z{0} z{0}` | `[real=QCD]` | real boost: `test_ME` passes; xsec != partonic-CM value. **Weak** — see below |
| M2 | `p p > z{0} j` | `[real=QCD]` | **discriminating**: `test_ME` on gluon-initiated channels |
| M3 | `p p > z{0} j` | `[QCD]` | **run**: `check_poles` 20/20 in all 12 P dirs, 2.193e+03 +- 1.2e+01 pb |
| M3 | `p p > z{0} z{0}` | `[QCD]` | **run**: `check_poles` 20/20 in all 4 P dirs, 1.217e+00 +- 6.6e-03 pb |
| M3 | `p p > z{0} z{0} j` | `[QCD]` | **run**: `check_poles` 20/20 in all 12 P dirs, 4.779e-01 +- 3.3e-03 pb |

**Which process tests what.** The two are complementary, but not in the obvious
way:

- `p p > z{0} j` — the Z recoils against the jet already at Born level, so the
  `me_frame` boost is non-trivial and non-longitudinal in *both* the Born and
  the counter-event, including in the singular region. This is the process that
  discriminates the azimuthal phase, and it doubles as the M1 cross-check
  against LO madevent.
- `p p > z{0} z{0}` — the Born boost is the identity (the ZZ system *is* the
  partonic CM), so it is a clean null test at M1 and exercises the real boost in
  the finite region at M2. In the singular region the boost degenerates to
  longitudinal, so it will **not** catch a wrong azimuthal phase.

Keep M1/M2 in the always-run set (fast, no MadLoop) and gate M3 behind the slow
marker. Run via `./tests/test_manager.py`, not pytest.

## 5. Open blockers

- **B1 — `xij_aor` cannot be recomputed after a boost.** See M2 step 4. Drives
  the `k_perp_dir` design. *Confirmed.*
- **B2 — `me_frame` leg remapping** between Born and real multiplicities (D2,
  plus the `skip` logic at `genps_fks.f:1206-1222`, `:1542-1553`).
  Sub-claim resolved: the `2**n` vs `2**(n-1)` convention is **not** a bug —
  `mapid` is `ids(i)=btest(id,i)` (`cluster.f:141`), which matches
  `sum(2**n)` at `banner.py:4869`. The comment at `genps.f:1758` saying
  `sum 2**(N-1)` is stale; fix the comment.
- **B3 — the `R_y(pi)` flip must be deleted, not boosted**, and
  `montecarlocounter.f:3000-3006` must not keep double-encoding it.
- **B4 — RESOLVED, both parts.** FSR counter-events do collapse onto the
  `vtiny` branch, exactly like ISR (they are handed the literal `one` for
  `y_ij_fks`). And `shybst = O(1-y) -> 0` in the FSR collinear limit, because
  it vanishes iff the mother is massless and `m_mother^2 = 2 E_i E_j (1-y)`.
  So FSR inherits the D3 equivariance property. See the M2 step 0 section.
- **B5 — RESOLVED structurally.** Rather than argue about which callers are
  reachable, every ME entry point was routed through a frame wrapper, making
  the boost a pure function of the momenta passed. Callers that share momenta
  then agree by construction. Worth stressing that this was not a theoretical
  hazard: in M1 a partial conversion produced a silent 3% shift once and the
  `momenta not the same in Born` stop once. See M2 step 1.
- **B6 — no guard against a lightlike/null `me_frame` sum** in `boost_to_frame`
  (`Template/LO/SubProcesses/genps.f:1761`). Pre-existing at LO; not replicated
  into the NLO port: `get_me_frame_boost` stops with a diagnostic instead.
- **B7 — RESOLVED.** `add_write_info.f:278` now goes through `sborn_frame`
  like everything else, so polarised event generation cannot write weights
  computed in a different frame from the cross section.
- **B8 — RESOLVED, and it was the M2 blocker.** A one-leg `me_frame` left that
  leg at rest only to rounding, and HELAS `vxxxxx` picks the quantisation axis
  from the momentum direction unless the 3-momentum is *exactly* zero. Fixed in
  both `boost_to_me_frame` (NLO) and `boost_to_frame` (LO). See M2 step 2.
- **B9 — mitigated, not eliminated.** A boost whose velocity degenerates to
  zero tilts the beams just enough to wreck `sqrt(p(0)+p(3))` in the HELAS
  massless spinors, without reaching the exact on-axis branch. Guarded by
  `betamin=1d-4` in `get_me_frame_boost`. The underlying fragility lives in
  HELAS and is not fixed; anything else that boosts an on-axis beam by a tiny
  amount will hit it. See M2 step 2.
- **B12 — RESOLVED here, and it has a twin that must land with it.**
  `ProcessDefinition.__iter__` dropped `polarization` when expanding
  multiparticles, so any polarised MadLoop-standalone process written with
  `p`/`j` came back silently unpolarised. Pre-existing, exposed by unblocking
  `[virt=…]`. Fixed in `base_objects.py` on this branch. The same defect sits
  in `ProcessDefinition.get_process` and in
  `process_checks.run_multiprocs_no_crossings`, both feeding the `check`
  command — fixed on `claude/quizzical-ptolemy-16f0c8` (`2b151185d`), which
  **must be merged alongside this change**, because opening `virt` in the
  guard is what makes `check … [virt=QCD]` reachable for a polarised massive
  particle in the first place. See M3.
- **B10 — RESOLVED, and it was the M3 blocker.** `check_poles.f` had been
  half-converted: its Born line went through `sborn_frame` while the
  `BinothLHA` call one line below still got the unboosted `p_born`, so the
  gate compared MadFKS poles in the me_frame against MadLoop poles in the
  partonic c.m.. This is B5 all over again — two consumers of one kinematic
  configuration disagreeing about the frame — but in a *driver* rather than
  in the integration, which is why the M2 sweep's "route every ME entry
  point through a wrapper" rule did not catch it: `BinothLHA` is not an ME
  entry point, it is a wrapper of one. Fixed at `check_poles.f:228`. See M3.
- **B11 — latent, documented, not fixed.** `NRotations_DP`/`NRotations_QP`
  re-evaluate the loop at a rotated phase-space point and expect `|M|^2`
  unchanged. That fails for a particle put at rest by a one-leg `me_frame`,
  whose quantisation axis is the frame z axis and does not rotate with the
  momenta, so MadLoop would report spurious instability. Both default to 0,
  so nothing is wrong today; a user who raises them on a polarised run will
  see it. Same root as B8/B9: the HELAS branch at exactly zero momentum.

## 6. Risk

M2 step 4 is the only genuinely hard item; everything else is mechanical. D2 is
the decision most likely to need revisiting, and M1 proves it out cheaply.
