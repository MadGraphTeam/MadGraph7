# here because it is wanted while the diagrams are generated, long before any
# exporter exists. False, or one of:
#   'speed' -- the current sums, and the diagram order which allows them. Wins
#              on cpu, where the amplitude calls dominate.
#   'slots' -- no current sums, and the order which keeps fewest currents
#              alive. Trades 6% more amplitude calls for 23% fewer
#              wavefunction slots at seven gluons, which is the trade a gpu
#              wants when occupancy is the limit.
#   'auto'  -- decide per process. Below merge_quartic_min_legs external legs
#              only the amplitude merges are taken, which shrink the JAMP
#              block for free; the seed rule -- and with it the reordering,
#              the current sums and the slots they cost -- is left off, since
#              below that size it does not pay for itself. At or above it,
#              generate as for 'speed' and let each output pick 'slots' when
#              the matrix elements go to a gpu backend and 'speed' otherwise.
#              The interface resolves the second half before anything reads it
#              again, so only the generation ever sees 'auto'.
# 'speed' and 'slots' are unconditional -- they are the way to ask for the
# merging on a small process anyway.

# rather than the result, see "Why this is not the default" in

# six and above it is a steady 5-8% with the source and the object file
# shrinking too. The amplitude merges alone, which is what is left below the
# threshold, are +4% at g g > g g g and neutral at four and five legs
# elsewhere, at the same slot count -- never a loss. See "Full sweep" in
