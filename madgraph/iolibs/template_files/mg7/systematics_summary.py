"""Percentages from madspace's systematics summary.

The summary madspace writes -- ``SystematicsCalculator::summary()``, stored in
``Events/<run>/info.json`` under "systematics" -- carries cross sections and
absolute uncertainties. Two places turn those into the percentages a person
reads:

* the run's own Systematics box (:meth:`launch.MG7Process.log_systematics_summary`);
* the parameter-scan summary column
  (:meth:`run_interface.MG7RunCmd.getSysSummaryFromLog`).

They must not disagree -- the same run printing one number in its box and a
different one in the scan table would be worse than either convention on its
own -- so the arithmetic lives here once and both format what it returns.

The conventions, which are the part worth getting right:

* **scale** is measured against the nominal cross section, up as
  ``(max - nominal) / nominal`` and down as ``(nominal - min) / nominal``. Both
  come back as positive magnitudes; the caller supplies the sign. This matches
  what systematics.py wrote, so a scan column does not shift when a run moves
  from the legacy path to the native one.
* **PDF** uncertainties are absolute in the summary, and are measured against
  the set's own ``central`` -- for a replicas set that is the replica mean, not
  the nominal member. An entry with no ``central`` had none that could be
  computed, and is skipped rather than measured against something else.

This module deliberately imports nothing: it is pure arithmetic over a dict, so
both callers can use it without dragging in the other's dependencies.
