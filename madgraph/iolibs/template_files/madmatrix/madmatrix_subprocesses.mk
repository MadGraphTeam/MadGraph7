# SubProcesses/makefile: dispatcher over the P* subprocess directories.
#
# This file contains no build rule of its own: the rules live in madmatrix.mk,
# which every P* directory links as its own 'makefile'. All this one does is fan
# out over the subprocess directories with a plain recursive make, so that GNU
# make's jobserver is shared by all the sub-makes. Running
#
#     make -j 18
#
# here therefore spreads 18 concurrent compilations over ALL the subprocess
# directories at once: no directory is built at a time with 18 jobs, and no
# directory is limited to 18/N jobs either. Whenever one directory runs out of
# work its slots are immediately picked up by the others.
#
# Every variable understood by madmatrix.mk (BACKEND, FPTYPE, USEBUILDDIR,
# HELINL, HRDCOD, LIBDIR, DEBUG, PROFILE, ...) can be given on the command line
# as usual; make forwards command-line variables to the sub-makes by itself.

SHELL := /bin/bash

# Group the output of each sub-make instead of interleaving it line by line
# (GNU make >= 4.0; silently skipped on older versions, e.g. the 3.81 shipped
# with macOS, where .FEATURES is undefined).

# The common library (built from ../src) is shared by every subprocess, so it is
# built once here, before the fan-out. MADMATRIX_COMMONLIB_EXTERNAL=1 then tells
# each P* makefile that this makefile owns the common library, and that it must
# not recurse into ../src on its own -- which is what N sub-makes running in
# parallel would otherwise all do at the same time, racing on the same objects.
#
# The common library is built *through* one representative subprocess directory
# rather than directly: madmatrix.mk already resolves BACKEND (including the
# 'cppauto' detection), FPTYPE, the compiler flags and the paths of src/ and
# lib/, and none of that has to be duplicated here.
