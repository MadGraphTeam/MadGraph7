"""The `bsm` tutorial -- physics beyond the SM, through an effective theory.

Uses SMEFTatNLO, the dimension-six Standard Model EFT at NLO in QCD.  It is in
the MG5 model database, so the first `import model` downloads it.  It teaches
the parts of BSM work that are not the SM's: a dedicated coupling order, an
order hierarchy under which the default search keeps the wrong diagrams, a
convention for that order which changes the process line, and the linear and
quadratic pieces of an EFT cross section.

The second half is the model rather than the process.  The same process is
written out twice, before and after `customize_model`, and the param card that
comes with the code is what the two lessons compare -- the Wilson coefficients
block by block, and the widths, which in an EFT move with the coefficients.
The last lessons are about those widths: what a small one costs an integrator,
and why a large one needs the complex mass scheme rather than a width dropped
into the propagators.

anything, which is the EFT on its own: a pure 1/Lambda^4 piece with nothing to
interfere with, and a prediction of nothing.

That is the trap `tutorial syntax` warns about, and in a model like this one it
is the default. Naming *one* order is enough to call the search off, and the
orders you do not name are then left unrestricted -- not held at whatever the
search would have picked for them. So `NP<=2` below bounds `NP` alone and
leaves `QCD` and `QED` free, which is exactly how the Standard Model diagrams
come back. `set default_unset_couplings N` changes that: the orders you leave
out are capped at N instead of being free, and MG7 prints which ones it
applied it to. The default is 99, which is no cap at all.

with the very coefficients you are varying, and a number typed in by hand is
wrong as soon as it does.

The coefficients are the other half, and most of them do nothing for this
process. They are in the card because they are in the model, and they will be
in every card, every scan and every reweighting until you take them out.

One more thing about the `DECAY` block, because a width is not just a number
to keep up to date. Small and large widths are two different problems.

**Small widths.** A narrow resonance is a near-singular integrand, so each
s-channel one gets a Breit-Wigner channel of its own, and `bwcutoff` in the
run card (15) says how far off shell still counts as on it. Below
`small_width_treatment * mass` (1e-6, same card) the width in the propagator
is lifted to that floor and the cross section corrected in the narrow-width
approximation. A width of exactly zero makes the particle stable.

**Large widths.** A broad resonance is the harder case, and not only
numerically. Putting `Gamma` into the propagators and nowhere else -- the
fixed-width scheme -- is not gauge invariant: the Ward identities tie
propagators to vertices, so a width in one and not the other leaves a
violation that grows with energy and can show up as a visibly wrong tail. The
gauge-invariant treatment is the **complex mass scheme**: the mass is made
complex once, `m^2 -> m^2 - i*m*Gamma`, everywhere it appears -- in the
propagators and in every coupling built from it, `sin(theta_W)` included --
so the identities hold term by term. That is one option in MG7:
%(p)s %(cms)s
""" % {'p': P, 'cms': CMS},

     hint="`set complex_mass_scheme True` -- it is a model-level option, so "

     solution=CMS),

Step('set', lambda interface: """
%(model)sMG7 re-imported the model for you: the scheme is not a flag applied
at the end, the complex masses have to be there when the couplings are built,
so the option only means anything through a fresh import -- your restriction
and its `param_%(restriction)s.dat` defaults included, as the log above shows.
Widths now come from the param card into the masses themselves, which is also
why `Auto` widths and this scheme belong together.

Two things to know before you rely on it. At tree level the check to run is
`check gauge`: gauge invariance is the thing a width in the propagators
breaks, so it is also the thing that says whether your treatment of it holds
up. It computes the same process in unitary, Feynman, axial and FD gauge and
compares the four. Give it a process with a massive vector inside, so the
Goldstone bosons have something to do:

  check gauge a e- > e- ve ve~ NP=0

Four numbers agreeing and `Passed` is what gauge invariance looks like from
here. Say the orders as always -- `NP=0` asks about the Standard Model part,
`NP<=2` includes the operators you kept, and each is a question worth asking
of a model you did not write. `check cms` is the one dedicated to the scheme
itself, comparing against the narrow-width approximation with the width
shrinking; `tutorial checks` covers the family.

And read `help set complex_mass_scheme` first: it says that masses become the
electroweak input parameters, and it warns that loop processes are not
supported.

Three more things that bite in EFT work:
  * **The convention is the physics.** Which `NP` value is one insertion, and
    so which squared order is the linear term, is the model's choice. Read its
    documentation before you write a process line.
  * **EFT amplitudes grow with energy**, by construction. A cross section
    dominated by events above your cutoff says the expansion has broken down,
    not that you found something.
  * **A restriction is part of your result.** `restrict_%(restriction)s.dat`
    and `param_%(restriction)s.dat` say which operators you kept and what the
    others were fixed to. `explain_restriction` reads one back, and
    `tutorial checks` is the tutorial to take before you trust a model you
    did not write.
