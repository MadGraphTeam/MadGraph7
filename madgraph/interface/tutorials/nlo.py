-- About the parton shower ---------------------------------------------------

`parton_shower` in the run card decides which shower the events are matched to,
and MC@NLO counterterms are shower-specific: the parton-level file you get can
only be showered with the one you chose. The default is **PYTHIA8**, which this
MG7 has installed, so `launch` will work as written.

(HERWIG6 is still selectable, but it is Fortran from the early 2000s and no
longer compiles with current gfortran, so do not reach for it expecting it to
build.)

SHOWER_NOTE_NO_PY8 = """
-- About the parton shower: read this before you launch ----------------------

`parton_shower` in the run card decides which shower the events are matched to.
The default is PYTHIA8, and **this MG7 does not have it**. Install it first:

  MG7> install pythia8
  MG7> install mg5amc_py8_interface

Both are needed -- the second is the bridge aMC@NLO drives Pythia8 through.
It takes a while, but it is the path that works.

If you would rather not wait, you can run the fixed-order parton level only:

  MG7> launch -p

**But understand what that gives you.** The .lhe file MC@NLO produces is
UNPHYSICAL on its own: the events carry the counterterms that cancel against
the shower's first emission, so individual events (and any distribution you
make from them) are only meaningful once showered. Use `launch -p` to check
that the machinery runs, never to get a number.

Do not reach for HERWIG6 as a substitute either: it is Fortran from the early
2000s and no longer compiles with current gfortran.
