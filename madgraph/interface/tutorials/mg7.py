This one assumes you have already run something -- `tutorial lo` if not. It is
about the settings that decide how long a run takes and how good the answer is.

The pieces:
  * **madspace** builds the phase space and evaluates the matrix elements. It
    is what `output` produces by default.
  * **VEGAS** is the default integrator: adaptive binning, no training, works
    everywhere.
  * **MadNIS** is the alternative: a normalizing flow trained on your process.
    It costs training time up front and pays it back in unweighting
    efficiency. It is not something you switch on -- `[madnis] enable` is
    `"auto"` by default, and MG7 decides per subprocess after a probe run.

Everything below lives in `Cards/run_card.toml`. Make an output to look at:

  [generation]      events, the survey iterations and target precision,

  [vegas]           the default integrator                              <-
  [madnis]          the trainable one                                   <-
  [multiparticles]  labels, as in the process line
  [histograms]      what to plot
  [postprocessing]  systematics after the fact
  [gridpack]        self-contained event generation

Start with the phase space, because a badly channelled integration cannot be
rescued by a better integrator:

  mode                  multichannel (default), flat, or both
  sde_strategy          diagrams or denominators -- how channels map to
                        diagrams
  t_channel, flat_mode  propagator, rambo or chili for the t-channel
  decays                all, massive or none
  bw_cutoff             how far off-shell a Breit-Wigner is followed
  drop_qcd_s_channel    drop channels with no QCD resonance once the channel
                        count would exceed this -- the lever for processes
                        with too many channels
  combine_channel_threshold, adaptive_symmetry_sampling

The symptom of bad channelling is a survey that will not converge and an
unweighting efficiency in the per-mille range, whatever you do to [vegas].

Then [vegas] itself: `bins`, `damping`, `start_batch_size`, `max_batch_size`,
`optimization_patience` and `optimization_threshold`. Raising the batch sizes
buys a better grid at a proportional cost; `damping` is what to reach for when
the grid oscillates instead of settling.

**MadNIS, and why you probably do not need to configure it.**

`[madnis] enable` is `"auto"`, and it means what it says. MG7 surveys the phase
space first, measures how badly the integrand varies (a relative standard
deviation across the channels), and then decides *per subprocess*:

  * two outgoing particles -- never. There is nothing for a flow to learn that
    the multichannel phase space has not already done. This is why
    `p p > t t~` trains nothing.
  * three -- only if the survey came out noisy, or you asked for more than a
    million events, or you are building a gridpack.
  * four or more -- always.

Auto mode also sizes the networks and picks the learning rate from that same
measurement, so the numbers printed in `Cards/run_card.toml` are starting
points, not the values that will be used.

There is no separate training command: training is a phase inside
`bin/generate_events`, which is what `launch` runs. It uses the GPU if
`[run] device` says so and torch can see one, and the CPU otherwise.

**When you do want to override it**, set `enable = true` or `false` outright,
and then touch things in this order:

  1. `train_batches`, `batch_size_per_channel` -- how much training, and how
     much per channel. Everything else is secondary.
  2. `lr`, `lr_scheduler` (none or cosine), `lr_decay`. If the loss is noisy,
     lower the rate before touching the network.
  3. `loss` -- stratified_variance, kl_divergence or rkl_divergence.
  4. only then the network shape: `flow_hidden_dim`, `flow_layers`,
     `flow_spline_bins`, `flow_activation`; `discrete_*` for the discrete
     dimensions; `cwnet_*` for the channel-weight network.

Setting any of these by hand overrides what auto would have chosen for it.

**Judge it honestly.** Compare three runs of the same process -- forced off,
forced on, and MadEvent -- on cross section (they must agree inside the quoted
errors), unweighting efficiency, and total wall time *including* training. A
flow that wins on efficiency and loses on wall time has not helped you, and
that is the trade auto mode is trying to call for you.

**One rough edge**, so you meet it here rather than mid-study: check which PDF
you are getting; the default is not the one a MadEvent run would have used.

Seeding works the way you would expect -- `set iseed 42` at the launch question
sets `[run] seed`, and so does editing the run card directly.

**Coming from a LO run card?** `madgraph/various/RunCardLO_to_MG7_mapping.md`
maps the old names onto the new sections.

**Gridpacks** work here too, via the `[gridpack]` section and
`bin/gridpack.py`.
