/**
 * Rejection-samples a weighted batch into an unweighted one.
 *
 * Keeps each event with probability `weight / max_weight` and returns the
 * surviving rows (Sec. 3.4 of [1]). The first argument and return value are the
 * weights; any further tensors listed in @p types are carried along and
 * gathered for the surviving events.
 *
 * `batch` is the leading batch dimension.
 *
 * **Arguments**
 * - the tensors named in @p types (the first is the event weight), plus
 * - `max_weight` – `float`, scalar – the weight to unweight against.
 *
 * **Returns**
 * - the tensors named in @p types, restricted to the accepted events.

/**
 * Partial unweighting of one batch, for the MadNIS replay buffer.
 *
 * The maximum weight is the @p quantile quantile of |w| over the batch (so a
 * fraction 1 - @p quantile of the events is over-weight). An event is kept
 * with probability min(1, |w| / w_max) and gets the weight
 * sign(w) * max(|w|, w_max): the sign of a negative weight (an interference)
 * is kept, and the quantile is over |w| like the acceptance, so that a mostly
 * negative batch is still unweighted. The `adaptive_prob` of a kept event, the
 * density it was sampled with, is multiplied by its acceptance probability and
 * by N / N_kept, so that training on the buffered events stays unbiased
 * (Sec. 3.4.1 of [1]).
 *
 * `batch` is the leading batch dimension.
 *
 * **Arguments**
 * - the tensors named in @p types (the first is the event weight, and one
 *   must be named `adaptive_prob`).
 *
 * **Returns**
 * - the tensors named in @p types, partially unweighted, with `adaptive_prob`
 *   rescaled.
