"""A minimum on the partonic sqrt(s), and the phase-space boundary it implies.

A cut on sqrt(s_hat) is a statement about the whole final state: nothing below
it can ever be generated, so the root propagator -- the virtuality the
luminosity mapping samples -- has a floor. Handing that floor to the sampler is
the difference between generating the region the cut allows and generating
everything and throwing nearly all of it away.

The process is g g > t t~, which has a kinematic threshold of its own at
2 m_t = 346 GeV. That threshold is what makes the central invariant testable:
a cut placed *below* it cannot remove a single point, so it must leave the
integral -- and here even the sampled points themselves -- untouched. A cut
placed above it must move the boundary without moving the integral.

Pinned down here:

  * obs_sqrt_s is the invariant mass of the two incoming partons,
  * a cut below the kinematic threshold changes nothing at all,
  * with a cut above it, no point below the cut is generated,
  * and doing so does not change the volume of the cut region, i.e. the
    boundary is a consequence of the cut and not an extra cut of its own,
  * a cut above the beam energy leaves an empty, finite result rather than an
    inverted sampling range.
