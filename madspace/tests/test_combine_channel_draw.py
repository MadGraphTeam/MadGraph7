"""Unit tests for select_combine_channel, the rule that maps a random index onto
the channel that owns it when combining events (see generator_data.hpp and
EventGenerator::read_and_combine).

The draw is over per-channel cumulative counts of the events each channel still
owes, with the random index uniform on [0, total). Every index must resolve to a
channel that still has a share left: read_and_combine decrements the drawn
channel's count, so handing out a channel with a zero share wraps an unsigned
counter, and the channel is then drawn far beyond the events its file holds.
