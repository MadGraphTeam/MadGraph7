"""The initial-state mirror against a matrix element that is not Lorentz
invariant (mg7 / madspace).

madspace covers the beam-swapped copy of an asymmetric initial state by drawing
a per-event "mirror" choice and, when it comes up, writing the event with
``py, pz -> -py, -pz`` -- the rotation by pi about x that moves each leg onto
the other beam. The weight it pairs with that event is the matrix element, and
the two only match if |M|^2 is invariant under that rotation.

It is, for every Lorentz invariant matrix element, and for a longitudinally
polarised one. It is **not** for a transversely polarised particle that
``me_frame`` holds at rest: HELAS then quantises the spin along the *frame* z
axis (the ``pp == 0`` branch of ``vxxxxx``) rather than along the particle's own
momentum, the mirror flips that axis, and the + and - states swap.

The observable consequence is a symmetry that must hold and did not: on a
symmetric proton-proton collider, with the quantisation axis tied to the beam
axis, sigma(z{+}) and sigma(z{-}) are equal -- there is no way to tell the two
beams apart, and the mirror is precisely what averages over them. Evaluating the
matrix element on the unmirrored momenta while writing the mirrored ones broke
that: measured 4485 +- 39 pb against 6060 +- 54 pb, 23 sigma apart. Note that
the *sum* over the three polarisations stayed right, which is why no unpolarised
test ever saw this.
