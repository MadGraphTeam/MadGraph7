"""[generation] interference_helicity: the helicity of an interference.

A helicity can contribute negatively to an interference (squared split orders
dropping a component). "exact", the default, draws the helicity of each event
as madevent does and the weight carries its sign, so the helicity is exact;
"summed" keeps the helicity sum as the weight (lower variance), and its
helicities, which then mean nothing, are written as 9 in the LHE. The matrix
element library is told through the umami parameter
interference_helicity_summed, sent only when asked for: a library made before
it existed refuses an unknown parameter.
